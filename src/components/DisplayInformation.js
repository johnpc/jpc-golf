      <h1>Welcome to the second (!) 2021 GolfA2 League!</h1>
      <small>See previous league results from <a href="https://s1.golfa2.com">the archive.</a></small>
      <p>
        Rounds are every Thursday for 8 weeks, starting August 5th at Huron Hills
        Golf Course. Please arrive around 5:30 for tee times starting at 5:40
        and 5:50.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your league fee of $110 includes only your greens fee - if you'd like to
        rent a golf cart, you can work that out with the pro shop. I believe
        cart rental is something like $8 a round.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the round, I'll be going to Buffalo Wild Wings for their BOGO
        wings deal, all are encouraged to join!
      </p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Pace of play is paramount - if you lose your ball in the rough, don't
        spend more than 2 minutes looking for it. Take a free drop in the area
        where it was last seen (only balls lost in hazards/out-of-bounds are
        assessed penalty). If you're racking up strokes, pick up your ball when
        you reach double par for the hole - that is the max score per hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may move your golf ball a few inches with your club head to improve
        your lie before swinging, but you may *not* move it to take an obstacle
        out of play. "Swing-and-a-miss" shots are not scored, and if you graze a
        ball to where you can still reach it with your golf club without moving
        your feet, you can redo the shot without counting the stroke (this may
        include chipping and sand shots as well).
      </p>
      <p>
        A putt is automatically considered "good" if you can lay your putter
        down to where part of the putter touches both the hole and the ball.
      </p>
      <p>Two mulligans are allowed per round, but cannot be used for putts.</p>
      <p>
        Only your first 9 holes are scored. If more holes are played after the
        first 9, do not include them when reporting your score.
      </p>
      <h2>Reporting Your Score</h2>
      <p>
        Scores should be reported on golfa2.com. Note that you should only
        report your score over par for the nine holes. So if you get a bogey on
        every hole, you should report a "9".
      </p>
      <p>
        The first two weeks of play are very important to calculate your initial
        handicap, which will continue updating throughout the league.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those raw scores are then converted into a league score. There are three
        league score points possible each week. The high handicap players on
        each team, the low handicap players on each team, then a combined "team"
        point. These are automatically calculated after all scores are reported
        on golfa2.com, so you don't have to worry about it too much.
      </p>
      <h2>Missing A Week</h2>
      <p>
        If you must miss a week, try to find an alternate in your place. There
        have been a number of volunteers to be alternates in case you don't know
        anyone yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known alternates:
        <ul>
          <li>John H</li>
          <li>Courtney</li>
          <li>Jimmy</li>
          <li>Alex's cousin</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to make up your score by playing another round before the next
        league day and report that score - otherwise you will forfeit both your
        point and your team point.
      </p>
      <h2>Prizes</h2>
      <p>
        Of course, bragging rights should be your primary motivation to win. But
        to up the stakes, each first place winner will receive a $25 Amazon gift
        card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the last place “winners” will be ordering Blazin’ wings at
        our final post-league bdubs outing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t worry - scores are handicap adjusted so you’ll have a fair chance
        of winning regardless of skill level.
      </p>
      <h2>Optional: Snake!</h2>
      <p>
        Each group will start the round with one "snake" token. Anytime someone
        (participating) three putts (or worse), they must carry the snake token.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whoever is left holding the snake token at the end of the round must buy
        a drink for the other participants in their group.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a golfer faces a long putt or has to drain their second, the other
        golfers in the group may hissssss like a snake to get in that golfer's
        head.
      </p>
      <p>(Shots played with the putter from off the green - including fringe - do not count)</p>
